BUGS:
LAG
still losing the ball on occasion
ball can be hit, so it has no vertical movement

BALANCE:
caught blocks draw too small (width-wise)
change sprite sizes based on window diagonal instead of width
    bat is ridiculously huge on different aspect ratios
tune direction ball moves when hit by bat (make the ball go vertically when hit right but never horizontally)
    MUCH CLOSER WITH THIS, STILL DOESN'T FEEL QUITE RIGHT
    hard code angles at certain hit areas?
        'skill' hit areas deflect accurately, other areas have a margin of variance

CURRENT FOCUS:
onion
    behaviors
pepper
    behaviors
bacon
    add
ketchup
    add
mustard
    add
hot sauce
    add
pickle
    constants to be unique instead of riding off of 'falling block'
create save file that tracks score between plays
    add ability to reset score
implement corner collision checks
add weight effects to catcher:
    catcher sinks with weight
    add total limit where catcher drops the sandwich

FEATURES:
add screen shake!
create menu and level states
charge up breaks multiple blocks (or some other benefit)
click falling items to interact
croissant shuriken to break bad items
save points between rounds
points can be spent in shops to upgrade things like:
    bat move speed
    catcher move speed
    one time use power up items (slow down time, targeted shot with condiments, etc.)
    swing cooldown
    extra balls (ball multiplier or extra lives)

DESIGN:
epic anime-style scene when getting a high score

ingredients:
    bats:
        sub roll (basic)
        baguette (heavy hits speed up ball and break multiple spots)
    good:
        -lettuce - drifts down like a leaf
        -pickles - pops into multiple blocks to catch
        -cheese - falls straight down
        onions - falls slowly and needs to be hit again by the ball to dice, or it bounces off and falls
        green peppers - takes multiple hits to slice up before falling
        bacon - power up hits make bacon crispy and worth more points (hot sauce bonus)
        egg - catch for points but if it's missed then it creates a slip trap on the ground for the catcher
        condiment bottles - falls to the ground and gets activated when stepped on by the catcher:
            hot sauce - powers up the bat so the ball breaks through multiple objects at high speed before slowing down
            ketchup - sprays a few random blocks so that their score is 1.5x higher when caught
            mustard - doubles the score of the last caught ingredient
    bad:
        socks (knock off some ingredients)
        trash bag (creates slipping hazards)
        jellyfish (paralyzes catcher for a few seconds)
        rocks (falls fast and weighs down sandwich until next ingredient is caught, removes rock and ingredient)
        fish (knocks off next caught ingredient and ingredient caught prior to the fish)
    interactions:

karate theme
serious karate master dog makes the sandwich hitting a tomato with a sub roll and knocks ingredients down where his
    energetic apprentice catches the toppings to score points

control the master dog,
catcher is on autopilot
