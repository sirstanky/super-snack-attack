BUGS:
pausing still runs the clock in delta time (leaves plummet after un-pausing)
    add clock in game loop to control game delta time
pause is janky because game updates after pause is initiated?

BALANCE:
change sprite sizes based on window diagonal instead of width
    bat is ridiculously huge on different aspect ratios
tune direction ball moves when hit by bat (make the ball go vertically when hit right but never horizontally)
    MUCH CLOSER WITH THIS, STILL DOESN'T FEEL QUITE RIGHT
    hard code angles at certain hit areas?
        'skill' hit areas deflect accurately, other areas have a margin of variance

CURRENT FOCUS:
put a 'position' parameter in 'add block' for the managers
    (or move block when hit to impact position and adjust speed for current delta frame time)
create save file that tracks score between plays
    add ability to reset score
create different kinds of target blocks for scoring mechanics and color code them
implement corner collision checks

add sprites
    create animations
add weight effects to catcher:
    catcher sinks with weight
    add total limit where catcher drops the sandwich

FEATURES:
add screen shake!
create menu and level states
charge up breaks multiple blocks (or some other benefit)
click falling items to interact
croissant shuriken to break bad items
save points between rounds
points can be spent in shops to upgrade things like:
    bat move speed
    catcher move speed
    one time use power up items (slow down time, targeted shot with condiments, etc.)
    swing cooldown
    extra balls (ball multiplier or extra lives)

DESIGN:
epic anime-style scene when getting a high score

ingredients:
    bats:
        sub roll (basic)
        baguette (heavy hits speed up ball and break multiple spots)
    good:
        lettuce
        pickles
        cheese
        onions
        green peppers
    bad:
        socks (knock off some ingredients)
        trash bag (creates slipping hazards)
        jellyfish (paralyzes catcher for a few seconds)
        rocks (fall faster)
        fish (knocks off next caught ingredient)
    interactions:

karate theme
serious karate master dog makes the sandwich hitting a tomato with a sub roll and knocks ingredients down where his
    energetic apprentice catches the toppings to score points

control the master dog,
catcher is on autopilot
