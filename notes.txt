BUGS:
caught blocks are not drawn in the correct positions
    size is changed when caught but sprite needs to be scaled for new size
LAG
    might come from looping through all the blocks multiple times per frame
        collisions - 1,000,000 in ball
            move collisions into blocks to save frames (eliminates an entire iteration through all the target blocks)
        draw - 1,000,000 in block manager
        create a fixed image for target and caught ingredients and update them on change to save on cycles?
    lettuce sin function taking large overhead?
        just use acceleration and decelerations instead?
still losing the ball on occasion
    looks like it bounces off of a block out of the screen when in the exact corner

BALANCE:
change sprite sizes based on window diagonal instead of width
    bat is ridiculously huge on different aspect ratios
tune direction ball moves when hit by bat (make the ball go vertically when hit right but never horizontally)
    MUCH CLOSER WITH THIS, STILL DOESN'T FEEL QUITE RIGHT
    hard code angles at certain hit areas?
        'skill' hit areas deflect accurately, other areas have a margin of variance
    ball should go perfectly vertical when hit at center y of bat, else goes at an angle against the bat's normal plane
adjust acceleration function for different directions instead of handling all in one?

CURRENT FOCUS:
piece sprites back together and add dropped state so game can be tested again with changes
add 'serving' behavior for round start
    let the player carry the ball and hit it when they are ready to begin
        allows for the adjustment of the ball's x position
        toss up and fall back down to be hit at an angle
        if ball is missed then give the player a new ball
add function to end round and gain points
    create new game state to display score and then go to main menu
        eventually have this go to the shop instead of the main menu
create shop
bacon
    add
ketchup
    add
mustard
    add
hot sauce
    add
create save file that tracks score between plays
    add ability to reset score
implement corner collision checks
add weight effects to catcher:
    catcher sinks with weight
    add total limit where catcher drops the sandwich

FEATURES:
add screen shake!
create menu and level states
charge up breaks multiple blocks (or some other benefit)
click falling items to interact
croissant shuriken to break bad items
save points between rounds
points can be spent in shops to upgrade things like:
    bat move speed
    catcher move speed
    one time use power up items (slow down time, targeted shot with condiments, etc.)
    swing cooldown
    extra balls (ball multiplier or extra lives)

DESIGN:
epic anime-style scene when getting a high score

ingredients:
    bats:
        sub roll (basic)
        baguette (heavy hits speed up ball and break multiple spots)
    good:
        -lettuce - drifts down like a leaf
        -pickles - pops into multiple blocks to catch
        -cheese - falls straight down
        -onions - falls slowly and needs to be hit by the bat to slice, or it bounces off and falls
        -green peppers - takes multiple hits to slice up before falling
        bacon - power up hits make bacon crispy and worth more points (hot sauce bonus)
        egg - catch for points but if it's missed then it creates a slip trap on the ground for the catcher
        condiment bottles - falls to the ground and gets activated when stepped on by the catcher:
            hot sauce - powers up the bat so the ball breaks through multiple objects at high speed before slowing down
            ketchup - sprays a few random blocks so that their score is 1.5x higher when caught
            mustard - doubles the score of the last caught ingredient
    bad:
        socks (knock off some ingredients)
        trash bag (creates slipping hazards)
        jellyfish (paralyzes catcher for a few seconds)
        rocks (falls fast and weighs down sandwich until next ingredient is caught, removes rock and ingredient)
        fish (knocks off next caught ingredient and ingredient caught prior to the fish)
    interactions:

karate theme
serious karate master dog makes the sandwich hitting a tomato with a sub roll and knocks ingredients down where his
    energetic apprentice catches the toppings to score points

control the master dog,
catcher is on autopilot
